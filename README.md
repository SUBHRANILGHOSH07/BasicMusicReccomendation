# Basic Music Recommendation ðŸŽµ

This project demonstrates a **basic machine learning model** that predicts a person's preferred music genre based on their **age** and **gender**.  
It uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** from Scikit-learn and includes model evaluation, visualization, and performance metrics.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `BasicMusicRecommendation.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with full code and explanations  
- `music.csv` â†’ Dataset containing age, gender, and music genre  
- `music-recommender.dot` â†’ Decision Tree visualization in Graphviz format  
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Loads dataset with Pandas  
- Trains a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- Splits data into **training and test sets**  
- Evaluates model with **accuracy score**, **classification report**, and **confusion matrix**  
- Visualizes the decision tree with **Graphviz**  
- Interactive prediction example: input age & gender â†’ get music genre recommendation

## ðŸ“Š Example Workflow
```python
# Train and predict
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
